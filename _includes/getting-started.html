{% highlight html %}
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://api.bridgeit.mobi/bridgeit/bridgeit.js"></script>
{% endhighlight %}

		2. Attach a BridgeIt call to some action element on your page, and provide a callback to handle returned values from BridgeIt.  For instance, a button to retrieve a contact from the address book...
	</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
bridgeit.fetchContact('myId', callback);
{% endhighlight %}
